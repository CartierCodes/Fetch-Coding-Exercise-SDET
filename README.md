## Run Instructions
1. Download and install Node.js from the website: https://nodejs.org/en/download (this installation includes npm which we also need)
2. Verify the installation of node and npm in terminal using the following commands: "node -v" and "npm -v"
3. If you do not have git installed, install it following instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
4. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/CartierCodes/Fetch-Coding-Exercise-SDET.git`
5. Navigate to the project folder
6. Run using the command `node findFakeBar`
7. You may see a windows alert asking you about permissions, hit allow.
## Notes
- This program will still work the same if more bars are added
- The program defaults to using a 'headful' browser window so the user can see what is going on. To run headless, simply set `RUN_BROWSER_HEADLESS` to `true` in line 2 of findFakeBar.js
  - Regardless of the above setting, program output will be found in the terminal it is run in
